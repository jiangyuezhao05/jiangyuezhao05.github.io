Starting from yesterday, I began a plan to go to bed early and wake up early.  
There are two main reasons for this.  
The first is that, according to scientific evidence, sleeping earlier is better for health (and I can prove it's true! I feel much more energetic, and my skin condition has improved a lot!).  
The second reason is that I want to live a more regular and organized life. I used to waste so much time scrolling the screen and ended up doing nothing.
However, I could have spent that time doing things that truly fulfill me and make me happier — so why not?

I used to love staying up late, but it turned out that it made getting up the next morning really hard.  
Even when I did get up, I often felt dizzy and found it difficult to concentrate in class.

Now, I feel that I’m living in a much better way than before.  
A better mood — thanks to those stable and trustworthy friends with whom I can share my daily life.  
A healthier and more energetic lifestyle — because I finally have enough rest, something I used to lack.  
And a stronger sense of accomplishment — because I’m trying to find my own path and build balance between coursework and research, instead of letting things slide.

Enjoy your day and this golden season of autumn!
