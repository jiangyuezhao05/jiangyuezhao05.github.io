The 8-day national holiday is a precious time for me to slow down and reflect on myself and the things that keep me busy.
Over the past month, I seemed to be constantly buried in all sorts of tasks, never having the time to think about whether I truly needed to do them or not.

I realized that I’m sometimes too cautious when starting something, which makes it hard for me to actually get moving.
After some trials, one possible solution seems to work:
Once you decide to do something, just do it.
Don’t waste time making redundant plans — open the book and start writing down your analysis process.
You’ll encounter problems along the way, but simply resolve them one by one.
It’s far better than daydreaming all day long.

Autumn is coming
------
I love the autumn in Shanghai. The temperature and humidity are just right, with a gentle breeze brushing against my cheeks.
I guess it won’t be long before the streets are covered with red leaves.
Looking forward to the 2-day trip next weekend :)
