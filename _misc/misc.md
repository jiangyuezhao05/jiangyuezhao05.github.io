Welcome to my **Miscellaneous Gallery!** 🌸  
I love music, reading, writing, and traveling.

### 🎵 Music  
Music gives me an immersive way to experience all kinds of thoughts, emotions, and moments in the world.  
Singing is an important way for me to feel and express my emotions.  
Listening to different kinds of music always brings me brand-new experiences — as if I were truly there.

### 📚 Reading  
I love reading biographies, documentaries, and poems.  
One of my favorite books is *The Shape of a Life: One Mathematician’s Search for the Universe’s Hidden Geometry* (《我的几何人生》), the biography of Shing-Tung Yau.  
I have read this book more than ten times since high school.  
Its poetic language and Yau’s lifelong pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty in mathematics have had a profound impact on me.

### ✍️ Writing  
Writing allows me to record and express my thoughts and feelings about different experiences and events.  
I run a personal WeChat Official Account, where I share reflections and stories from my life.  
In my first year of university, I was honored to be selected as one of the “Reading Stars” (5 out of thousands).

### 🌍 Traveling  
I have traveled to more than 40 cities over the past few years, gaining unique and precious memories in every one of them.  
To me, travel is not only a way to relax, but also a way to observe, reflect, and connect with the world.  
I believe I will keep exploring new places in the future — measuring the world with my own footsteps.
