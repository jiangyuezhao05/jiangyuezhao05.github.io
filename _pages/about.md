<p>
  Hi, this is Jiangyue! I am a third-year undergraduate student at 
  <a href="https://sime.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME)</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)</a>. 
  I am fortunate to be part of the Pilot Class of Interdisciplinary Science, co-organized by 
  <a href="https://riis.sufe.edu.cn/jxChinese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIIS</a> and 
  <a href="https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITCS</a>, where I receive interdisciplinary training in operations research, computer science, and economics.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests lie broadly in <strong>Operations Management</strong>, 
  and I am currently exploring <strong>experimentation</strong> and <strong>causal inference</strong> as tools for decision making in complex operational settings.<br>
