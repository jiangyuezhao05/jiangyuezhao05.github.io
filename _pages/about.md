Hi, this is Jiangyue! I am a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE).

I am fortunate to be part of the Pilot Class of Interdisciplinary Science, co-organized by RIIS and ITCS, where I receive interdisciplinary training in operations research, computer science, and economics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Information Systems (IS) and Economics. More specifically, I employ statistical and econometric methods to empirically examine humanâ€“technology interactions through the lens of behavioral economics.

Current Research
================

<p>
  My recent research focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithmic biases, and behavioral economics. 
  I am particularly interested in how human behavior interacts with AI platforms and algorithms, and how these dynamics can be better understood through the lens of behavioral economics.

  I am fortunate to be advised by

I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to host and engage in in-depth conversations with Chris. He has provided me with invaluable advice on my academic career, life choices, and even philosophical topics.

Other words
===========

I enjoy reading and writing very much, usually in Chinese.

I hope this webiste to be a good start for me to share my opinions and thoughts on daily life, study, and research, whatever, in English. :)
