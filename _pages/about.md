<p>
  Hi, this is Jiangyue! I am a third-year undergraduate student at 
  <a href="https://sime.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME)</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am fortunate to be part of the Pilot Class of Interdisciplinary Science, co-organized by 
  <a href="https://riis.sufe.edu.cn/jxChinese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIIS</a> and 
  <a href="https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITCS</a>, where I receive interdisciplinary training in operations research, computer science, and economics.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests lie at the intersection of Information Systems (IS) and Economics. More specifically, I employ statistical and econometric methods to empirically examine human–technology interactions through the lens of behavioral economics.
</p>


Current Research
================

<p>
  My recent research focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithmic biases, and behavioral economics. 
  I am particularly interested in how human behavior interacts with AI platforms and algorithms, and how these dynamics can be better understood through the lens of behavioral economics.
</p>

<p>
  I am fortunate to be advised by  
  <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/yulin-fang/" target="_blank">Prof. Yulin Fang</a>, 
  <a href="https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/JICHENGZENG" target="_blank">Prof. Jicheng Zeng</a>, and 
  <a href="http://sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-594-298.html" target="_blank">Prof. Xiaocheng Liu</a>, 
  as well as 
  <a href="https://christopher-thomas-ryan.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Chris T. Ryan</a> and 
  <a href="https://runshanfu.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Runshan Fu</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://econen.sufe.edu.cn/69/2f/c6876a92463/page.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Zhenxin Huang</a> also offeres me valuable advice on behavioral economics and career development.
<p>

<p>
  Their guidance and insights have been invaluable in shaping my research and providing me with professional advice. 
  I am deeply grateful for their support.
</p>

<h1>People</h1>
<p>
  I’m very thankful to Zhenxin, who introduced me to the emerging field of behavioral economics with his deep understanding of society and remarkable economic insights. 
  His innovative way of teaching left a strong impression on me and truly changed how I view society and the world to some extent.
</p>

<p>
  I’m very thankful to Yulin, who opened the door to IS research for me and introduced me to the frontier of IS studies.

  I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to host and engage in in-depth conversations with Chris. 
  He has provided me with invaluable advice on my academic career, life choices, and even philosophical topics.

<h1>Other words</h1>
<p>
  I enjoy reading and writing very much, usually in Chinese.
</p>

<p>
  I hope this website will be a good start for me to share my opinions and thoughts on daily life, study and research—whatever, in English. :)
