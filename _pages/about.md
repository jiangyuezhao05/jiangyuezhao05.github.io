Hi! I am a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE).

I am fortunate to be part of the Pilot Class of Interdisciplinary Science, co-organized by RIIS and ITCS. This selective program is designed for students who aspire to academic careers and emphasizes an interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates the mathematical foundations of operations research, computer science, and economics.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Information Systems (IS) and Economics. More specifically, I am fascinated by how humanâ€“technology interactions can be explained through the lens of behavioral economics.
